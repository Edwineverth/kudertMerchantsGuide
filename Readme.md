Solution of the Kudert Merchant's Guide:
Requirements:
Node.js version = 8.11.3

Execution of the Program:
To run the program you must start from the console ("CMD, TERMINAL, POWER SHELD,")
The command is executed:
node. \ kudertMerchantsGuide.js

When you start the program, you will ask us to enter the aliases, as shown in the example:

ALIAS: "ALIAS" IS "ROMAN NUMBER"
ALIAS: pouet is I
ALIAS: plouf is V
ALIAS: cuic is X
ALIAS: boum is L

The insertion of the aliases is measured according to the seven symbols of the Martian numbers.
In the case of not wishing to enter stop, write the letter "n"

When the entry of the numbers is completed, the corresponding phrase is entered, based on the aliases entered.

The sentences or questions must have a sequence:

Example:
F: how much is cuic boum pouet pouet?
Answer: cuic boum pouet pouet is 42

To ask how many Dollars a specific Object is, you must first enter how much the object costs in Dollars.
Example:
Insert:
pouet pouet Empanada is 68 Dollars

Insert:
how many Dollars is pouet plouf Empanada?

Departure:
pouet plouf empanada is 136.00 Dollars

You can not enter how much an object costs in dollars, without entering the value of the object.

When entering another type of phrase or question the program will respond as follows:
Insert
F: how much bread does he enter in a bakery during a full-moon night?
Departure
